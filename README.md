# React Router DOM: Unexpected Route Navigation Behavior

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in React Router DOM v6 where navigating to a route before a component on a parent route has fully loaded can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.  Specifically, if a child route's component attempts to access data or resources that are not yet available from the parent component, it can cause errors or render inconsistencies.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to `/dashboard` directly.  You'll likely observe an error or the component rendering incompletely.
5. Refresh the page and then navigate to `/dashboard` to see the expected behavior once the parent component has completely loaded.

## Solution

This issue is addressed by using the `useLocation` hook along with a state management technique to ensure the data is available from the parent component before the child component renders.  The `useLocation` hook allows for controlling the navigation behavior and ensures that the child route only renders if the necessary data is ready.
